# Quick Start - Developer

A repository for helping new developers/engineers to quickly start up improving their skills.

## Troubleshooting

Your systematic approach to troubleshooting should involve five basic steps;

- Information Gathering
- Analysis and Planning
- Implementation of a solution
- Assessment of the effectiveness of the solution
- Documentation of the incident

Below we will address these steps individually.

**Information Gathering**  Before we can determine how to address a problem--or even assess what the problem is--we must gather information. Gathering information can be particularly challenging when the problem manifests itself at the client side. You might have to formulate your questions carefully in order to get meaningful information. Log files contain great information you should consult during the data-gathering stage. Try to avoid assumptions. If you reach the end of analysis and can not find the issue re-visit the information you have and look for where an assumption has been made. This is a great opportunity to slow down and carefully read documentation and logs, do not skim them.

**Analysis** Once we have gathered the data (including attempting to reproduce the problem), it's time to analyze the data.  The primary task in this phase is to look for patterns. An important part of the analysis phase involves prioritizing. This includes prioritizing the problems, if there are multiple problems. Performance problems are generally less urgent than access problems.

**Solution Implementation** Although there could be several possible solutions to a problem, you should always implement one change at a time. Assess the results of that change before trying something else. This will save you time in the long run. Start with the most obvious or most impactful change first, if they are all not obvious or may not be impactful, go with the easiest to validate.

**Assessment**  It is vital that you assess the results of your actions and determine whether the "fix" worked, whether it was a temporary work around, or whether it caused additional problems.

**Documentation** After completing your assessment, you should develop a summarization of the problem, which should include the reported and observed symptoms, the corrective actions taken, and the results of those actions.

## Asking for help

As an engineer you will eventually hit things you just don't know and your google-fu is failing you.

## Standards

Standards are great and help make a project flow better. If you are starting a fresh project try to follow all of the best practices and get them in place before a lot of code is there. It's much hard to follow best practices after the fact. The caveat to this is when working on  an existing project do not, try to change to some new standard. Follow the existing set of principles in place and get to know the project and it's developers before trying to enfore some new "standard" on them.

- [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Standard-Targets.html), one standard when working on open source repositories is common conventions. Common make targets also flow over to other systems such as ruby, python. Though perl chose a different standard with `make test` instead of `make check`. Generally follow these standard targets unless you need to disregard them.
